#' Weight the dataset
#' 
#' In the absence of  survey data weighting, there's a risk over or under-represent certain demographic segments compared to their true level in the whole population.
#' 
#' The use of weights in survey analysis compensates for this differential representation, thus producing estimates that relate to the target population.
#' Weights vary due to differential sampling rates because of oversampling and because response and coverage rates vary across sub populations (specifically hard-to-reach demographic groups). The term weighting refers to the  different amounts of load or emphasis we give to each individual survey response. Responses from a type of person who is very rare will get greater emphasis in the final results. In contrast, respondents who represent common types of people will be de-emphasized. 
#' Weighting are also important for the anonymization process
#' 
#' This functions perform the following:
#'  * look for element in the dico object that starts with weight_
#'  * Check the structure of this weight and identify what type of weight it is
#'    (cluster or strata)
#'  * transform each related frame into a survey object  
#'  * inform user about the weighting that is applied
#'  
#' @param datalist An object of the "datalist" class as defined in kobocruncher 
#' @param dico An object of the "kobodico" class format as defined in kobocruncher
#' 
#' @return datalist with applied weight

#' @export
# kobo_weight <- function(){
