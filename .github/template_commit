# Define a direct explicit title with main tag
# Explication for tags:
# [ci] : everything related to ci, even the ci fix for the moment
# [fix] : fix a bug in the code base
# [feat] : the addition of a new feature
# [doc]: package doc, we should see that on these 3 days roughly
# [test]: for unit tests
# [refactor] : Refactoring of code, like factoring, moving code
# [style]: for code formatting, tabulation, ...
# [chore]: everything that touches the project itself, classic background tasks, like a version upgrade


# Example: [feat]: Create my_fun to build xml
# 50-character subject line
# Add an empty line after that title

# Note that all lines that starts with #, will not be included
# in your commit message
# Choose one or more tags to add: the main and the secondary ones
# Possible tags from most to less important (see more info below):
# ci, fix, feat, doc, test, refactor, style, chore
