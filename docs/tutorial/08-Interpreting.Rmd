## Joint Data Interpretation

Actionable recommendations can be generated only with a collaborative process! - People sitting together and discussion how to interpret the data in relation with they key programmatic assumptions in order to __transform information into evidence__

## Engage with technical expert before sessions


.pull-left[

Request each focal point from multifunctional team to share their programmatic assumptions

 * What do they assume about the population?

 * What do they see as the most critical need?

 * One slide to be prepared and shared per expert with a list of their assumptions
]
.pull-right[

Start from assumptions and associate to them graphs from crunching output in order to give foundation for potential data stories according to narrative frames:

 * Shed light on a previously unexplored topic

 * Introduce an interesting angle

 * Provide useful suggestions to solve a problem

 * Disprove an hypothesis / debunk a widely held belief in terms of programmatic assumption
