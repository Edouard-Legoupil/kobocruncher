## Setting up the environment

2 options:

 - Start with Rstudio Cloud for training and testing
 
 - Then install your own Rstudio on your computer for production stage

Recall that all slides and code for this training are available on GitHub:

## Option 1: RStudio Cloud


.pull-left[

Good option if you are a __first time user__ and in order to get a first introduction! 

- Sign-up for a free RStudio Cloud account (https://rstudio.cloud/)

- Click "START" to open the project and get started

- RStudio Cloud has the same features and appearance as RStudio for ease of use

Github repo is for future reference, all material on RStudio cloud

## Option 2: Use your own RStudio environment

.bg-blue[
For data Protection reason, this needs to be done as soon as you are working with production data
] 


.pull-left[

Install Software

  1. [Install R](https://cran.r-project.org/): follow instruction from the installer.

  2. __Only for windows user__ [Install RTools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools): This executable is needed to install the package from github. Follow instruction from the installer.

  3. [Install R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) : follow instruction from the installer

You can now Launch __R Studio__ and open a new project. 

You may check the list of common issues in the [Common Troubleshooting](articles/Troubleshooting.html) article.

Create project

  *  In R Studio, select File, click New project. A box opens
  
  *  Choose New Directory
  
  *  Choose Empty project
  
  *  Type the name of the folder where you want to put your data
  
  *  Select where you want to put this folder
  
  *  Click Create project

## Exploring Rstudio Interface

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '80%'}
#knitr::include_graphics("../../inst/rstudio6.png")

## Package installation from Github


.left-column[
![alt text](../../inst/file.png)
]

.right-column[

Create an R script and paste the following command: 

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, message=FALSE}

# Run package installation if you don't have these packages already
# As a reminder, installing takes package from internet to your computer 
# and only needs to be done once, not each session

install.packages("devtools")
### Install Key unhcRverse packages in order to get the corporate style & brand
devtools::install_github('vidonne/unhcrdown')
devtools::install_github('vidonne/unhcrthemes')
devtools::install_github('galalH/riddle')
## Now get kobocruncher
devtools::install_github("edouard-legoupil/kobocruncher") 

``` 

you can then click on the Run button to `execute` the command one by one

GitHub has a rate limit of 60 requests per hour for unauthenticated requests, but 5000 an hour for authenticated requests. 
So the easiest solution is to create a GitHub PAT, with `usethis::browse_github_pat()` and add it to your `.Renviron` file with `usethis::edit_r_environ()`.

one for the training in case...

## Check the package is installed after you run the package installation command 


.pull-left[
 
See the package tab in the right-down panel

You can search for the package name `kobocruncher`

You can click on the blue link to access the documentation

## R Markdown: how to combines __R code with text__ ?

.pull-left[


Rmarkdown files have an `.Rmd` extension.
 
 1. Embed your data processing code within `snippet`
 
 2. Knit to different __output format__: PDF, DOCX, HTML, PPTX, and more

 3. Don't copy/paste output to your manuscript/report. __Make your manuscript/report with R Markdown__

 4. __Automatic styling__ table, figure numbering, colors, font, etc.. 

 5. Can create __parameterized reports__. Example: run an analysis for each state and each state gets a report

For beginners: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html. 
Actually this presentation is built from an [Rmd file](https://github.com/Edouard-Legoupil/kobocruncher/blob/main/docs/tutorial/01-First_Report.Rmd)

Each time document is Knitted, a self-contained session is started.  Prevents problems with depending on something in your environment that aren't explicitly called out

## Now Let's create our first report!!!


.pull-left[

To start with, let's use the first template "KoboCruncher A - Exploration"

To do so, from the top menu on the left:

> file  > New file  > R markdown   > From Template


In the process you may be requested to install missing packages, do so as required

## Save you notebook file and check the report __parameters__

.pull-left[

In an RMD report, the top part of the file, the header is called [YAML]().

A YAML header contains YAML arguments, such as “title”, “author”, and “output”, demarcated by three dashes (—) on either end.

![alt text](../../inst/rstudio4.png) 

]

.pull-right[

The YAML header for this template contains also a few parameters. 

They have values by default that can be adjusted


 *   `datafolder`: "data-raw" ## This is the default folder where to put you data in
 *   `data`: "data.xlsx" ## Name of the data file
 *   `form`: "form.xlsx" ## name of the xlsform - 
 *   `language`: "" ## Check what you have in your xlsform - ::english (en) -or ::french (fr) or ::spanish (es)

.bg-blue[
We will review the other parameters in the following sessions 
] 




]

???
 *   `datasource`: "Study name reference" ## String used in caption for all your charts
 *   `ridl`: "ridlproject" ## Name of the ridl project where you data is documented and archived
 *   `publish`: "no" ## put to "yes" in order to add your report, source and analysis plan as ressource within the same ridl c
 *   `republish`: "no"
 *   `visibility`: "public"
 *   `stage`: "exploration_initial" ## you may change this to exploration_advanced if you configuring many

## Editing a notebook is simple!

## Let's review the chunk to run the demo!

Each line with a `#` will not be executed

Remove the `#` at the beginning of line 69 & 70 so that the report use the demo dataset

Then click on the `knit` button

## Et Voila! You just built your first report!!


```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%'}
# ![alt text](../../inst/firstreport.png) 
knitr::include_graphics("../../inst/firstreport.png")
```

## What happenned?

The xlform defines data types for each variable

Based on the data types, a standard graph is generated:

 * `select_one` simple bar chart
 
 * `select_multiple` bar chart
 
 * `integer` or `numeric` or `date` histogram
 
 * `text` word cloud

Later we will see how to configure charts based on `crosstabulation`

# Thank you

__Next session__: [02-Relabeling](02-Relabeling.html) the way your survey variables are labelled for data collection is not always optimal when the goal is display the resulting information, hence you need to relabel (mostly shorten and simplify) the survey content
